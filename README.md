# svd-img

A simple program in rust to compress images using SVD approximation.

I guess there are better ways to compress as I just used double precisions numbers in compressed files, it could store many zeros so that it's not that efficient :-(

This is providided without any warranty of any kind.

Based on crates `image` and `nalgebra`.
